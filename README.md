# Boggle

This project is an attempt to create [Big Boggle](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/10550/big-boggle) for easy playing online.

### Game information

Big Boggle is like [Boggle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boggle), but bigger. It's a 5x5 board instead of a 4x4 board.

These are the original Big Boggle dice values, but Boggle Deluxe and other versions have very slightly different die ([source](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/300883/letter-distribution)).
