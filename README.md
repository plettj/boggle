# Boggle

[Big Boggle](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/10550/big-boggle), or 5x5 Boggle, ~~is~~ _was_ impossible to play with friends over long distances.

### How to Play

Head to [plett.fun/boggle](https://plett.fun/boggle) to play now! Generate and share unique boards with your friends.

Currently, guessing words isn't possible, so you'll have to manage the rest of your game yourself. Hopefully that's coming soon<sup>TM</sup>.

Just a 5x5 Boggle board generator for now.

### Game information

Big Boggle is like [Boggle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boggle), but bigger. It's a 5x5 board instead of a 4x4 board.

Q is Qu.

These are the original Big Boggle dice values, but Boggle Deluxe and other versions have very slightly different die ([source](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/300883/letter-distribution)).
